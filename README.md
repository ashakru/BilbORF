# BilbORF
Open science project developing an R package for performing differential ORF usage analysis  

### Background

Our goal is to aid analysis of translation in the context of differential isoform utilisation. The number of variants and isoforms, or as has been recently proposed proteoforms, of known proteins far exceeds a fixed, gene-centric, set of 20,000 sequences. Some estimates put the figure of 70,000 or even few millions proteoforms produced in the human genome, if all post-translational modification are included. Another layer of proteome complexity is provided by the discovery of new coding regions that were missed by the consensus annotations. BilbORF analyses how the translation of given Open Reading Frames (ORFs) is affected by differential transcript isoform usage.
