## Prerequisities 

### Previous work on isoform-aware ORF translation 

[ORFanage](https://github.com/alevar/ORFanage) from [Varabyou et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-023-00496-1)

- assign open reading frames (ORFs) to known and novel gene transcripts while maximizing similarity to annotated proteins
- no support for novel ORFs (not annotated yet) 

[ORFquant](https://github.com/lcalviell/ORFquant) from [Calviello et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-020-0450-4)

- performs isoform identification based on short Ribo-Seq data
- quatifies isoform specific ORF translation
- limitted capacity to perfrom accurate isoform calling, no intergation with RNA-Seq supportted isoform quantification
